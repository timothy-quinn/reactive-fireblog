    <p>Information, Technology, Security, and other stuff.</p>
    <p>My name is Timothy Quinn, but you can call me Tim.</p>
    <p>I live in Canberra, the capital city of Australia. I went to the University of Canberra, earning myself a Bachelor of Information Technology.</p>
    <p>I currently work for Cogito Group, a Canberra-based company, as a Digital Identity & Security Consultant. I'm also a Managing Director of Congruent Labs, a Canberra-based software development consultancy. Most of my skill is in Smart Cards, Public Key Infrastructure and Identity Management, and I develop software in a variety of languages (C#, Java, JS, etc.). More information about my work history and what I do can be found on my  LinkedIn page.</p>
    <p>Check out my Bitbucket account or my Github account to see some publicly releasable things I have written. Hit me up if you want to collaborate on something.</p>
    <p>The best way to contact me is via email at tim@timothy-quinn.com. Alternatively, you can hit me up on Twitter @timo_quinn or Keybase.</p>
    <p>This blog has no affiliation with my employers, and does not represent my employers in any way, shape or form. It's just me and my own opinions.</p>
